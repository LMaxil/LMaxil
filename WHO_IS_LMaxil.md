I am a hardworker.
I like to wake up and do things i don't like to do.
I love going to the gym, I am an amateur powerbuilder, but coding is a challenge for me, that's why...
  I am learning, reading, watching 100's of videos about coding, and kinda coding (i do my best)

i started coding a few days ago ( 5 - 01 - 2024) 
  But I LOOOOOOVE challenges, if something goes wrong, i won't stop untill i got it. Try me!!
